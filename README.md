# WinUI3Preview3_Problems_ColorPicker

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating the ColorPicker in both UWP and WinUI3 Preview 3 Desktop.

The UWP sample code works as expected. However, the WinUI3 Preview 3 Desktop sample code crashes when loading the ColorPicker.

-------

**Describe the bug**

ColorPicker from the XAML Controls is unable to load and crashes program in the WinUI3 Preview 3 Desktop sample solution.

**Steps to reproduce the bug**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to the ColorPickerWinUIPreview3 folder.
3. Open the ColorPickerWinUIPreview3 solution in Visual Studio 2019 Preview.
4. Build and run with Debug x64.

**Expected behavior**

We expect the application to display a ColorPicker on the MainPage.

We expect to see the same behavior we saw in UWP. 

Build and run the ColorPickerUWP solution inside the TextBoxUWP folder to see expected behavior.
